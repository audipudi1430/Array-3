        Approach:
        1. Use bucket sort to count how many papers have a given number of citations.
        2. Create a `bucket` array of size (n + 1), where n = total number of papers.
           - bucket[i] = number of papers with exactly i citations
           - All citations >= n are grouped in bucket[n]
        3. Traverse the bucket from the end (highest citation count) to the beginning:
           - Accumulate total papers with at least `i` citations.
           - The first `i` where total papers >= i is the h-index.

        Time Complexity: O(n) â€” One pass to fill the bucket, another pass to find the h-index.
        Space Complexity: O(n) â€” For the bucket array of size n+1.
